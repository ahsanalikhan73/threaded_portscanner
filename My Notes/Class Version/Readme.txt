Both the scanners have same functionality and works fine.
The little difference is in there code.

Multi-Threaded Port Scanner - 01
-----------------------------------
This scanner has two separate functions for connecting the ports.


Multi-Threaded Port Scanner - 02
-----------------------------------
This scanner has one common function for connecting the ports. 
The little mistake is that, if the port is close, then it will return nothing. it will 
only respond to the open ports.
